{
  "rules": {
    ".read": false,
    ".write": false,
    "users": {
      "$user_id": {
        ".read": "$user_id === auth.uid",
        ".write": "$user_id === auth.uid",
        "expenses": {
          "$expense_id": {
            ".validate": "newData.hasChildren(['description', 'note', 'createdAt', 'amount'])",
              "description": {
                ".validate": "newData.isString() && newData.val().length > 0"
              },
